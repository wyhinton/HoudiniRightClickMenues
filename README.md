# Custom Houdini Right Click Menues
I use a good number of installed packages, and I've always wondered how the custom right click menu's for the packages worked. After some amount of trial and error, I was able to figure out how add my own menus. In this tutorial we'll be creating a ```PARMMenu.xml```, which is the right click window that appears when right-clicking on a parameter.

First we need to make our package. I'll create a master folder, ```WebbLib``` and create a ```scripts``` folder and ```PARMMenu.xml``` file inside of that:

```
- WebbLib
 - scripts
 - PARMMenu.xml
```

I then added the following WebbLib.json to my houdini packages folder - C:\Users\Primary User\Documents\houdini19.0, creating an environment variable ```WEBB_HOU``` that with the path to my WebbLib folder:

```js
{
    "env": [
        {
            "WEBB_HOU": "C:\Users\Primary User\Desktop\LabsInstall\WebbLib"
        },
    ],
    "path": "$WEBB_HOU"
}
```

Here's the xml for my PARMMenu.xml:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<menuDocument>
	<menu>
    <subMenu id="Webb">
      <label>Webb</label>
      <insertBefore />
      <scriptItem id="Say Hello">
        <label>set Optype Python</label>
        <scriptCode><![CDATA[
print("hello")
      ]]></scriptCode>
      </scriptItem>
    </subMenu>
	</menu>
</menuDocument>
```
And here's our menu it is!

It's pretty painful to write actual python in the menu's XML file. A better practice is to write your code in your packages ```scripts``` folder, then ```import``` it into the menu. I created a directory ```webb``` within my ```scripts``` folder, then created a ```say_hello.py``` script. Our function ```main``` will receive a ```kwargs``` argument generated by our right click. In this case, kwargs has information about our right click action, as well as the parameter we clicked on.  


```
- WebbLib
 - scripts
   - webb
    - say_hello.py
 - PARMMenu.xml
```

```
#say_hello.py
def main(kwargs):
    print(kwargs)
    print("hello")
```

Then we import our ```say_hello``` script into our menu:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<menuDocument>
	<menu>
    <subMenu id="Webb">
      <label>Webb</label>
      <insertBefore />
      <scriptItem id="Say Hello">
        <label>Say Hello</label>
        <scriptCode><![CDATA[
import webb.say_hello
webb.say_hello.main(kwargs)
      ]]></scriptCode>
      </scriptItem>
    </subMenu>
	</menu>
</menuDocument>
```
Here's the output:

Unfortunatley, as of 19.5 the only way to refresh our menue is to restart Houdini. So I'll usually do as much of the python development in a "dummy" shelf tool as possible, then plug it into my right click menu. 

I've included the code to reproduce this in the repo.
